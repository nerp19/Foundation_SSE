You have been asked to help a scientist with their project investigating the interaction between an increasing number of objects.  
Initially, they wish to know the total binding energy of 3 objects for a given geometry.

The formula for the binding energy, u, of a pair of objects separated by distance, r, is given by:

u(r) = 4 × ε × ((σ/r)^12 - (σ/r)^6)

where  
σ = 3.41 × 10^-10 m  
ε = 1.65 × 10^-21 J

An example binding energy for r= 6.82 × 10^-10 m is -1.0 × 10^-22 J

The binding energy for larger numbers of objects is the sum of all the pairwise interactions.  
The scientist has provided the distances between the three pairs of objects they are initially interested in:

r(object1 – object2) = 4.1 × 10^-10 m  
r(object1 – object3) = 2 × 10^-10 m  
r(object2 – object3) = 3.41 × 10^-10 m  

Implement a solution to meet the scientist’s needs.
